# Definitions of Errors #

This is a pretty simple version of error list. e.g. I define the case "ID should not be included" as "Invalid property name ID" where ID is treated as an invalid property name in a Driver object during POST. Also I use "Invalid value in $Resource" when there's type error in the car/passenger/driver object.

Status codes are

- 400 for invalid property names
- 500 for invalid property values. (An error message is received from MongoDB)

Check my code for details. ðŸ˜Š
